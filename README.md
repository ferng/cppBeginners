# cpp beginners handbook
* I found this in a zip file on a backup drive.
* The stuff is from july 2010 
* This is simply the exercises from a book. At one point I thought about trying C++. But the language seems overly complex (even now).
* It's probably beyond me so I'll stick with java, C, javascript and python (go looks nice too).
